# DESIGN

Design notes for mata-ll. This document describes what *is* and how it is
achieved, as opposed to SPEC.md which describes what *should be*.


## Compilation pipeline

The compiler is split into two Rust crates: `mllc` (the library) and
`mll` (the CLI). A third crate, `mllc-wasm`, exposes `compile_mll()`
for the browser playground. The pipeline is:

    Source (.mll)
        → Lexer          tokens
        → Parser          AST
        → Import resolver merged AST (prelude + imports + user module)
        → Desugarer       AST with do-notation eliminated
        → Type checker    Typed IR (TIR)
        → Monomorphizer   specialized TIR
        → Code generator  Lua source
        → .lua output

Each stage is a separate module (`lexer.rs`, `parser.rs`, `modules.rs`,
`desugar.rs`, `typechecker.rs`, `mono.rs`, `codegen.rs`). The prelude
(`lib/Prelude.mll`) is embedded at compile time via `include_str!` and
prepended to every module before desugaring.


## Lexer

The lexer is layout-sensitive. It emits `Indent(n)` tokens at the
start of each indented line and `Newline` tokens between lines. The
parser uses these to determine where declarations begin and where
continuation lines belong. Blank lines and comment-only lines are
skipped.

Identifiers starting with a lowercase letter produce `Ident` tokens;
those starting with uppercase produce `UpperIdent`. Operators are
sequences of the characters `! # $ % & * + . / < = > ? @ ^ | - ~ :`,
except that `->`, `=>`, `::`, `<-`, `=`, `|`, `..` are recognized as
distinct tokens. Block comments `{- ... -}` nest.


## Parser

The parser is a hand-written recursive-descent parser with operator
precedence climbing for infix expressions. It maintains a fixity table
(`HashMap<String, (Assoc, u8)>`) populated by `infixl`/`infixr`/`infix`
declarations. Backtick notation (`` `foo` ``) turns any function into
an infix operator.

Layout-sensitivity is handled by an indentation stack. Continuation
lines indented deeper than the start of an expression are merged into
it. This gives Haskell-like layout without explicit braces.

The parser produces an AST with these main node kinds:

- **Declarations**: type signatures, function definitions, data/newtype
  definitions, class/instance declarations, export signatures, type
  families, imports, fixity declarations.
- **Expressions**: variables, constructors, literals, application,
  lambdas, infix application, negation, if/then/else, case, let/in,
  do blocks, type ascriptions, record construction, tuples.
- **Patterns**: variable, wildcard, constructor, literal, tuple.
- **Types**: concrete, variable, application, arrow, list, IO,
  ScopedLuaIO, Forall, LuaPure, LuaIO (FFI), LuaIterator, LuaTry,
  tuple, constrained.

GADTs are detected by a `where` keyword after the type name in a data
declaration. Each GADT constructor carries its full type signature
rather than a field list.


## Desugaring

A single pass over the AST that eliminates do-notation:

    do { x <- e; rest }     →  e >>= \x -> rest
    do { e; rest }           →  e >>= \_ -> rest
    do { let x = e; rest }   →  let x = e in rest
    do { e }                 →  e

Guards and where clauses are preserved as-is for the type checker.


## Type system

### Hindley-Milner with extensions

The type checker uses Robinson unification at its core. Type variables
carry a unique `u32` ID; rigid (skolem) variables use `u32::MAX` and
refuse to unify with anything else. Type schemes (`Scheme`) quantify
over a list of type variables.

Top-level definitions require explicit type signatures. The checker
operates in synthesis mode (infer and unify) for most sub-expressions,
with the top-level signature providing the starting type that flows
inward.

### Kind system

A small, fixed kind system:

- `Type` — the kind of ordinary types
- `Symbol` — the kind of type-level strings (used in FFI)
- `Arrow(k1, k2)` — the kind of type constructors

No kind polymorphism or promotion. The checker validates kinds for
data definitions, type families, and type applications.

### Typeclasses

The built-in classes are `Monad`, `Show`, `Eq`, and `Ord`. Each class
is registered with its methods and a set of built-in instances for
primitive types. User-defined classes and instances are also supported.

Instance resolution maps `(class_name, type_name)` to an `InstanceInfo`
containing the mangled method names (e.g., `eq_Integer`, `show_String`,
`ord_lt__Number`). Superclass constraints are tracked.

Orphan instances (where neither the class nor the type is defined in
the current module) are rejected.

Deriving is supported for `Show` and `Eq` only.

### GADTs

GADT constructors carry their full return type. Pattern matching on a
GADT constructor introduces local type equalities via unification.
The refinement is purely compile-time; runtime representation is
identical to standard ADTs.

### Rank-2 types

`forall s.` quantification is supported in two specific patterns:

1. Exported functions receiving `LuaFunction s` (scope safety for
   Lua callbacks, same mechanism as Haskell's ST monad).
2. `runST :: (forall s. ST s a) -> a` (scope safety for mutable
   state).

General rank-2 polymorphism is not supported.

### Type families

Both intrinsic and user-defined type families are supported. The
intrinsic ones (`LuaPure`, `LuaIO`) reduce during type checking:

    LuaPure "name" a  →  a
    LuaIO "name" a    →  IO a

User-defined type families use closed, equation-based matching.

### Error handling

Type errors are accumulated (not fatal on first error) and reported
together. Error kinds include unification mismatches, occurs-check
failures, unbound variables/constructors, arity mismatches,
non-exhaustive patterns, and signature mismatches.


## Monomorphization

### Strategy

The monomorphizer walks the typed IR, collecting concrete type
instantiations. For each unique `(function_name, concrete_type)` pair
it generates a specialized copy with a mangled name (e.g.,
`map_Integer_List_Integer`). Call sites are rewritten to use the
specialized name.

Typeclass method calls (e.g., `show`, `==`) are resolved to their
concrete instance functions during this pass.

### Polymorphic recursion fallback

When a function calls itself at progressively different types (e.g.,
`showDeep :: Show a => Deep a -> String` calling itself at
`Deep (Box a)`), monomorphization would diverge. The monomorphizer
counts specializations per function. When the count exceeds 16, it
switches that function to dictionary-passing: typeclass methods are
looked up from a Lua table parameter passed at each call site. Existing
specializations for that function are discarded.

This gives zero-overhead dispatch for the common shallow cases and
bounded overhead for the rare deep-nesting case.


## Code generation

### Lua runtime preamble

Every generated `.lua` file begins with a preamble defining the
runtime support functions. This is a Rust string constant (`PRELUDE`)
appended by the code generator. It includes thunk infrastructure,
list primitives, `show`/`eq`/`ord` instances for primitives, list
operations (`map`, `filter`, `take`, `zipWith`), HashMap operations,
ByteString operations, STArray operations, bitwise operations, and
FFI helpers.

### ADT representation

Multi-constructor types use Lua tables with an integer tag at index 1
and fields at subsequent indices:

    data A = A String | B Integer Integer

    A "hello"  →  {1, "hello"}
    B 17 23    →  {2, 17, 23}

Single-constructor types with exactly one field (including newtypes)
are not represented as Lua tables — the value *is* the field directly.
Newtypes compile to identity functions:

    newtype Radians = Radians Number
    →  local function Radians(_v) return _v end

Pure enums (all constructors zero-arity) are plain Lua integers:

    data Color = Red | Green | Blue
    →  local Red = 1; local Green = 2; local Blue = 3

### Record backing store

Records are backed by plain Lua tables with integer keys matching
constructor field order. These tables are created and consumed
exclusively by mata-ll generated code; plain Lua does not interact
with them directly.

Record field accessors are generated as simple index functions:

    local function perName(_r) return _r[1] end

#### Record update (not yet implemented)

Record update syntax (`foo { x = 3 }`) requires producing a new table
that shares all fields with the original except the updated ones. This
should be a **shallow copy**: iterate the table slots and patch the
changed fields.

A shallow copy is correct because:

- Field values are either Lua primitives or references to other mata-ll
  values (tables or thunks). These are all safe to share by reference.
- A deep clone would be wrong: it would force thunks prematurely or
  duplicate shared structure, breaking both laziness and identity
  semantics.
- The tables are exclusively managed by mata-ll, so there is no risk of
  external mutation violating the immutability invariant.

Cost is O(n) where n is the total number of fields in the record,
since all slots are copied regardless of how many are updated. This
is acceptable for typical record sizes.

### Maybe representation

`Nothing` is Lua `nil`. `Just` is the identity function. This makes
Maybe zero-cost for the common case and allows pattern matching via
`== nil` / `~= nil`.

### List representation

Lists are cons cells: two-element Lua tables `{head, tail}` where
`nil` is the empty list. Lazy tails use `__mll_lazy_cons(head, thunk)`
which sets a `__lazy` flag; `__mll_tail` forces the thunk on first
access and clears the flag.

The runtime provides `map`, `filter`, `take`, and `zipWith` as Lua
functions that produce lazy cons cells, enabling infinite lists and
fusion-like behavior.

### Tuple representation

Plain Lua tables with integer indices: `{e1, e2, e3}`. No tag; the
type system distinguishes tuples from ADTs.

### Closures and partial application

Functions with multiple parameters compile to multi-argument Lua
functions. When fully applied, the call is a direct multi-argument
call. Partial application generates a closure:

    add :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
    add a b = a + b
    inc = add 1

    →  local function add(a, b) return a + b end
       local function inc(a) return add(1, a) end

### Pattern matching

Pattern matching compiles to nested if/elseif chains. Constructor
tags are checked at index 1; fields are extracted from subsequent
indices. Each clause becomes a branch. Guards are interleaved as
additional conditions within branches. Non-exhaustive patterns fall
through to `error("Non-exhaustive patterns")`.

### Forward declarations

All user-defined functions are forward-declared (`local f1, f2, ...`)
before any definitions, enabling mutual recursion without ordering
constraints. Forward-declared names are marked concrete so references
to them skip `__force`.

### Exports

Exported functions appear in the module's return table. Each export is
wrapped to deep-force return values (via `__mll_to_lua`) and wrap Lua
callback arguments (via `__mll_wrap_callback`) so that the boundary
between mata-ll and plain Lua is clean.

### Standalone mode

When the module has a `main :: IO ()` declaration, the compiler
appends `__run()` at the end of the generated Lua file. `main` is
renamed to `__run` internally because it is not an exported function.
The CLI can also execute the result directly via the embedded `mlua`
runtime (`--run` flag).


## Evaluation strategy

### Non-strict evaluation

Function arguments and let/where bindings are wrapped in memoizing
thunks by default. A thunk is a two-element Lua table with a
metatable: `{thunk_fn, forced_flag}`. Forcing a thunk calls the
function, replaces it with the result, and sets the flag:

    local __thunk_mt = {}
    local function __thunk(f)
        return setmetatable({f, false}, __thunk_mt)
    end
    local function __force(x)
        if getmetatable(x) == __thunk_mt then
            if x[2] then return x[1] end
            local val = x[1]()
            x[1] = val
            x[2] = true
            return val
        end
        return x
    end

### Cheapness analysis

The code generator decides whether to thunk or eagerly evaluate each
expression. Cheap expressions skip thunk allocation:

- Literals, variable references, constructor applications
- Arithmetic on cheap operands
- Tuple construction of cheap elements
- Applications of known top-level functions to cheap arguments

Expensive expressions (calls to unknown functions, calls to parameters,
complex nested expressions) are wrapped in `__thunk`.

### Demand analysis

A separate pass (`demand.rs`) determines which function parameters are
forced on every code path through the body. A parameter is strict if
it is forced in *all* clauses and all branches within each clause.

Pattern matching forces its scrutinee. Case scrutinees and if
conditions are always strict. The analysis intersects strictness
across clauses: a parameter is strict overall only if strict in every
clause.

Strict parameters can be passed eagerly at call sites (avoiding thunk
allocation) and forced at function entry rather than at each use site.

### Concrete variable tracking

The code generator maintains a set of names known to hold non-thunk
values (`concrete_vars`). References to concrete variables skip the
`__force()` call entirely. The set is seeded with all runtime
primitives and forward-declared function names, and grows as
assignments to known-concrete values are encountered.

### Call-site analysis

A whole-program pass before code generation examines every call site
to determine:

- Which parameters are always passed cheap (non-thunk) arguments
- Which parameters are ever called as functions (enabling a different
  optimization path)

When all callers pass concrete values for a given parameter, the
function entry can skip forcing that parameter entirely.

### Inlining

Small, pure, non-recursive functions with a single clause and no
guards are identified as inline candidates. At call sites, their
bodies are substituted with parameters replaced. This eliminates
function-call overhead for trivial helpers.

### Bind chain flattening

Monadic bind chains (desugared from do-notation into nested
`>>=`/lambda sequences) are flattened into sequential local
assignments:

    do { x <- action1; y <- action2 x; return y }

Instead of generating nested function calls, the code generator
unrolls these into:

    local x = action1()
    local y = action2(x)
    return y

This avoids the overhead of intermediate closures and IIFEs for
sequential IO/ST operations.

### Operator translation

Haskell operators map to Lua:

    ++    →  ..
    &&    →  and
    ||    →  or
    /=    →  ~=
    div   →  //
    mod   →  %


## FFI

### Type families

FFI bindings use type families that the compiler consumes during code
generation and then erases:

- `LuaPure "name" a` — pure call, reduces to `a`. Compiles to a
  direct Lua function call.
- `LuaIO "name" a` — effectful call, reduces to `IO a`. Compiles to
  a thunk-wrapped Lua call forced in monadic context.
- `LuaIterator "name" a` — wraps a Lua iterator factory into a lazy
  mata-ll list via `__mll_iter`.
- `LuaTry "name" a` — wraps a Lua function that returns `(val, err)`
  into `IO (Either String a)` via `__mll_try`.

`Maybe` arguments in FFI signatures translate to optional Lua
parameters: `Nothing` omits the argument, relying on Lua's `nil`
default.

### LuaIO s (scoped monad)

The parser disambiguates `LuaIO "name" a` (FFI type family, string
literal first argument) from `LuaIO s a` (scoped monad, type variable
first argument). These are distinct AST nodes internally.

`LuaFunction s` is opaque; it must be given a concrete type via
`engage` before calling. The `forall s.` on the enclosing function
seals the scope, preventing the function from escaping. This is the
same mechanism as Haskell's ST monad.

### Export boundary

Exported functions wrap return values with `__mll_to_lua` (deep-forces
thunks, converts cons lists to Lua arrays) and incoming Lua callbacks
with `__mll_wrap_callback` (deep-forces arguments before forwarding).
This ensures the FFI boundary is clean in both directions.


## Module system

Each `.mll` file is a module. Import syntax:

    import Data.Tree                    -- import all
    import Data.Tree (depth, Tree(..))  -- selective
    import qualified Data.Tree as T     -- qualified

`Data.Tree` maps to `Data/Tree.mll` on disk. The module loader
searches the source directory first, then added library paths. Loaded
modules are cached.

The prelude is auto-imported by the compiler (prepended to the AST
before desugaring). Additional standard library modules live in `lib/`:

    ByteString, LIO, LMath, LOS, LString, LBit, Regex, JSON


## ST monad and STArray

`ST s a` is the pure mutable-state monad with the same runtime as IO.
The distinction is purely at the type level: `runST :: (forall s. ST s a) -> a`
uses rank-2 quantification to prevent mutable state from escaping.

`STArray s` is a mutable integer array backed by a Lua table. All
operations (`newSTArray`, `readSTArray`, `writeSTArray`,
`modifySTArray`, `stArrayLength`, `newSTArrayFromList`,
`stArrayToList`) carry the scope tag `s` and run in `ST s`. Indices
are 0-based externally, converted to 1-based internally for Lua.

At runtime, `runST` is just `__mll_run` (force and call), and the
array operations are plain Lua table manipulations. The scope safety
is enforced entirely by the type checker.


## HashMap

HashMap is a compiler built-in backed by plain Lua tables (using Lua's
native hash-table implementation). It is not a user-defined ADT.
Operations (`hashmap_insert`, `hashmap_delete`, `hashmap_lookup`,
`hashmap_keys`, `hashmap_values`, `hashmap_member`, `hashmap_fromList`)
are provided in the runtime preamble. Insert and delete produce new
tables (shallow copy), preserving immutability.


## ByteString

ByteString is backed by Lua strings with explicit byte semantics. All
operations are implemented as a Lua table of functions (`__mll_bs`)
indexed by operation number. Indices are 0-based externally, converted
to 1-based for Lua's string library internally. Operations include
construction, deconstruction, querying, transforms (map, foldl, xor,
zipWith), and binary encoding (little-endian 8/16/32-bit reads and
writes).
