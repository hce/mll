## Typeclasses and dispatch

- [x] Eq as a proper typeclass gating == and /=
- [x] Ord as a proper typeclass gating <, >, <=, >=
- [x] Monad typeclass and >>= operator
- [x] Desugar do-notation through >>= instead of hardwiring

## Missing types and values

- [x] HashMap k v (intrinsic dictionary type, backed by Lua tables)
- [x] Any type (Lua interop: String | Integer | Number | Bool | Null | ...)
- [x] getArgs :: IO [String]
- [x] exit :: IO ExitValue (data ExitValue = Normal | Err Integer)

## Codegen optimizations

- [x] Prelude runtime functions seeded as concrete
- [x] Monadic bind chain flattening (do-blocks → flat IIFEs)
- [x] If-expressions as statements in bind chain terminals
- [x] Small pure function inlining at call sites
- [x] Typeclass methods inlined as Lua operators
- [x] Whole-program call-site analysis for parameter concreteness
- [x] Eliminating __mll_run: compile-time type info instead of runtime introspection
- [x] Demand analysis for parameter strictness (per-function, branch-aware)
- [x] return/pure optimization: thunk only when argument contains unknown function calls
- [x] CI wasm build job with artifact upload
- [x] Record field accessors inlined as direct table indexing
- [x] Forward-declared functions packed into __mll_fn table (eliminates 200-local limit)
- [x] IO actions as proper closures (IO can't leak into pure code)
- [x] ST primitive inlining in gen_action (zero-overhead in bind chains)

## Open

- [x] Cross-function demand propagation (if callee is strict in position j, propagate to caller)
- [x] Full strictness analysis (demand-driven call-site decisions, is_cheap_arg retained for trivial expressions)
- [x] Monad typeclass dispatch for >>= and >> (instances for IO, LuaIO, ST; proper error on missing instance)

## Parser

- [x] Multi-line function application (continuation lines indented past function column)
- [x] Multi-binding `let` in `do` blocks
- [x] Guards in combination with `where` clauses

## Haskell compatibility gaps

- [x] Eq for [a] and Maybe a (parameterized typeclass instances)
- [x] deriving Ord
- [x] List comprehensions
- [x] Backtick sections (`(`div` 2)` as a function)
- [x] Local function definitions in do-let (`let f x = ...`)
- [x] Inline case syntax (`case x of { A -> ...; B -> ... }`)
- [x] Module export control (export list parsed and enforced in typechecker)
- [x] where blocks at module level

## Known limitations

- [ ] Typechecker stack overflow on CPS-heavy types (Regex library with many test functions overflows 256MB stack; needs iterative type inference)

## Can defer

- [x] Lambda pattern matching

## String types (design decision)

String = Lua string permanently. ByteString = Lua string with explicit byte semantics (same runtime representation, type-level distinction only). Text = future UTF-8 type over ByteString, if/when Unicode support is needed.
